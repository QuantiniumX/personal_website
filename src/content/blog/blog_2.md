## Can't seem to think stuff
I often have problems properly articulating my thoughts into something concrete that can be explained in proper wording. I cant seem to find a way to start this. 

Even while solving a problem (suppose leetcode or something while doing a project), even though i have the knowledge of stuff that is needed to solve the problem, I can't seem to find the flow of stuff or how to apply that.

I think that is generally because we look at the problem from a broader perspective and due to that we can't seem to think or even get the idea on how this problem can be broken into easier and much more solvable problems and even if we try to break the bigger problem into smaller parts within our brain, it doesn't help much as processing things as well as remembering things is hard.

## The voices are gone
I didn't write anything down as i thought i could fit everything in my brain and i could solve anything in my brain and then implement it. This is what i have been doing all my life. But it seems it doesnt work anymore. I kinda stopped having thoughts (the voices in my head just stopped someday and its silent) and it became real difficult to find solution to any difficult problem.

One of the ways that helped me bring them back is to write stuff down
- Write the idea or the problem you wanna solve on paper. Digital things like excalidraw, tldraw, etc dont work for me.
- Think about the ways that this thing can be solved. 
- Write down your thought process and the flow of things on how you think this will be solved. Try to write literally anything that comes to your mind.
- After this try to select the things that you think would really work and implement those.
- If they don't work out, just write more things down and implement them.

## Key points
<span class="text-gruvora font-bold">Writing is Understanding</span> - If you can't write something clearly or concisely that another person or you from the future can't understand it, you(present one) don't understand it.

<span class="text-gruvora font-bold">Writing is thinking</span> - Writing is more than just recording your ideas - its a process of thinking itself. When you write down your thinking process, you are throwing stuff out of your system, freeing that allocated memory in brain and giving space for new ideas to be allocated in place of them.

<span class="text-gruvora font-bold">Writing is self-reflecting</span> - When we write something down, we have something concrete on our hands. So now we can reflect on that thing and can improve on it. If we write the things down, in that process only we may come to know that the reason we can't solve it because we dont have the prerequisites to solve this problem and therefore have something tangible to work with.
