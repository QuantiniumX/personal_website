- Did some error handling of stuff. I kinda like how go does these things. try/catch doesnt feel good to write. where are my nils.
- implemented jwt and password hashing. I have done bcrypt hashing in c++ before. Gonna learn how bcrypt algorithm actually works.
- Learned about multer. My server can handle file uploads.
- reviewed back different http methods and codes.
- Wasnt able to do much leetcode today. Did 1 LC question tho. gotta maintain the streak.
 
tbh backend seems more fun to do than frontend. go feels better to do these things than js. idk just saying from how i felt writing stuff in go (the vibe).
