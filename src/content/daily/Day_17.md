- Started to make the backend for my project.
- Just drew all the tables data and integrated sqlite with my server.
- Wrote the route for user registration. Writing all other are gonna be a breeze as all is set up.
- Tried to use Postman, insomnia,etc properly as they are so called industry standards but just gonna stick to curl (just gonna store everything in .md as i do for everything else).
