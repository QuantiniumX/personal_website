Didn't write anything as i didn't do much progress on 4th day and then college started again and i got much less time to do stuff and i got ill too. Well these are excuses ig so we start again. Why do i feel anxious while writing these. No-one reads these anyway except me. 

Just gonna summarize what i did in these days

- Started doing <a href="https://leetcode.com" class="font-bold text-gruvora no-underline hover:underline" >leetcode</a> properly and i wanna maintain it for long. I think i can break big problem into small problems now. Didn't know leetcode was this fun.
- In total i did 20 LC questions in these days. 14 - Easy, 5 - Medium,  1 - Hard
- Gave a <a href="https://codeforces.com/" class="font-bold text-gruvora no-underline hover:underline">codeforces</a> contest and gonna do it every week - have to get better at competitive programming.
- Read about 150 pages of the discrete mathematics book - Will restart to read this as this is a really fun book to read.
- Learned some backend in go. Can make REST API's with proper error handling.
- Did some progress on my local media server project. Will start working on this properly on this while doing leetcode.
- I think i got selected for a hackathon. Gonna have to grind ML for this hackathon.
- Did some progress on my blog.
- Stepped in the expressjs land. I need to actually learn stuff that gives job.
- Didn't practice much monkeytype these but gonna get on that from today.

Yeah i think thats all i did.
