- Added the movies, tvshows database so that it can automatically fetch the details of the media to show it on the frontend.
- Added the routes to access the your own media data from the database to the frontend.
- Started making the frontend. idk how to design the website. I can browse the movies and can actually watch stuff on the website just have to pre-encode the media before as i haven't implemented live-transcoding.
- Started learning rust and read the rust lang book till chapter 7. Rust is a good language. I like how the things are implemented in the language such as the Results, options, lifetimes, string stuff, traits etc
- Completed 26 question of rustlings.
